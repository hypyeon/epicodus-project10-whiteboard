# Whiteboarding 
Participated by [Hayeong Pyeon](https://github.com/hypyeon) and [Daniya Yelemessova](https://github.com/DaniyaYelemessova)

## Description
- This is a whiteboard (technical interview preparation) session provided as an independent project of Epicodus. 
- Each interviewee comes up with solutions for each challenge. 

## Questions 

### Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

```
Example Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Expected Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"
```

### Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

```
Example Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]
Expected Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]
```

### Question #3: Compressing Strings
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

```
Example Input: "aaabccdddda"
Expected Output: "3ab2c4da"
```

### Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

```
Example Input 1: "hello"
Expected Output 1: false

Example Input 2: "copyright"
Expected Output 2: true
```

### Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

```
Example Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]
Expected Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]
```

## Setup Requirements
